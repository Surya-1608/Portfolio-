## Overview

This SQL script analyzes COVID-19 data using queries that extract insights on total cases, deaths, infection rates, and vaccinations. The dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations from different locations over time.

### Dataset Used

The script operates on two tables:

**CovidDeaths**: Contains data on total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population for various locations and dates.

**CovidVacinations**: Contains data on vaccinations administered per location and date. 

This SQL script offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing COVID-19 data, covering cases, deaths, and vaccinations across multiple locations. Key functions such as NULLIF, MAX(), CAST(), JOIN, and window functions ensure accurate calculations and insights. This analysis can be extended by incorporating additional datasets or visualizing results in BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.
